# weather-app

Weather app created to practice NodeJs. It fetches the weather data from Dark sky and Mapbox. Test the app at: https://zares-weather-app.herokuapp.com/

# What I have practiced with this:
- Asynchronous code,
- Call Stack, callback queue and event loops,
- HTTP requests,
- Callback functions,
- Object property shorthand and destructuring,
- Express,
- App deployment for production
